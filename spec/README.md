# Specs

Design artifacts for the verification conveyor. This directory is the
knowledge layer of the system; executable pipeline code lives elsewhere.

## Status

Phase 0: document and schema only. There is no `cell_lint` yet, no pilot
calibration, and no claim that the conveyor exists. Every material statement
in `CONCEPT.md` carries a status from the evidence-first ladder; design
intents are `open` and carry limitations.

## Reading order

1. `CONCEPT.md` — thesis, trust policy, layers, taxonomy, verdicts, ceiling.
2. `cell-registry.schema.json` — the machine-readable shape of a cell.
3. `cells.seed.yaml` — uncalibrated seed cells, all `open`.
4. `guard-grammar.md` — what L2 can and cannot model.

## What this is not

- Not a certification, an audit, or a compliance statement.
- Not a throughput claim. Numbers such as review time or cell count are
  `open` until measured on a pilot.
- Not a replacement for the skills. `CONCEPT.md` depends on
  `negative-test-first`, `evidence-first-docs`, and `invariant-first-code`
  for content and evidence discipline.
